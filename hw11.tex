\problem{Ex 21.3} Prove Holder's inequality for $p=1$ and $q=\infty$.

	\begin{proof}
		Let $f \in L^1$ and $g \in L^\infty$. By definition $g$ is bounded and $\norm{g}_\infty$ is the magnitude of the least upper bound of $g$. Then
		\begin{align*}
			\int \vert fg \vert & \leq \int \vert f \norm{g}_\infty \vert \\
			& = \norm{g}_\infty \int \vert f \vert \\
			& = \norm{g}_\infty \norm{f}_1
		\end{align*}
		Thus $fg$ is absolutely integrable and Holder's inequality holds.
	\end{proof}

Prove that $L^\infty$ is a Banach space with the norm $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$. \bigbreak

	\begin{proof}
		Let $f_n \in L^\infty$ be a sequence of functions that is Cauchy with respect to the norm $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$. First we will justify that $\{f_n\}$ converges pointwise and we will call the limit $f$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given and choose $N$ such that for any $n,m > N$ it is the case that $\norm{f_n - f_m}_\infty < \epsilon$. Let $x$ be in the domain. Then $\vert f_n(x) - f_m(x) \vert \leq \norm{f_n - f_m}_\infty < \epsilon$. So the sequence $\{f_n(x)\}$ is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers and is therefore convergent. Define $f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)$. Also, note that since $N$ is not dependent on $x$, this convergence is uniform.  \bigbreak
		
		Furthermore we will show that $\norm{f}_\infty$ is bounded. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given and choose $N$ such that for any $n> N$ and any $x$, we have that $\vert f(x) - f_n(x)\vert < \epsilon$. Since this is true for all $x$ we can say that $\norm{f- f_n}_\infty \leq \epsilon$. Then
		\begin{align*}
			\norm{f}_\infty & = \norm{f - (f_N - f_N)}_\infty  \\
			& \leq \vert \norm{f - f_N}_\infty - \norm{f_N}_\infty \vert \\
			& \leq \epsilon + \norm{f_N}_\infty
		\end{align*}
		Thus Since $f_N \in L^\infty$ we have that $f$ is bounded and thus $f \in L^\infty$ and $L^\infty$ is complete. We conclude that $L^\infty$ is a Banach Space with the norm $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$. 
	\end{proof}

\problem{Ex 22.1 (BBT, ex 13:6.1)} Let $g\in L^1[0,1]$. Show that the map $f\mapsto\int fg$ is a bounded linear functional on $L^\infty[0,1]$.

	\begin{proof}
		Since integration is linear this is obviously a linear functional. Let $f \in L^\infty$. Then
		\begin{align*}
%			\left \vert \int fg \right \vert & \leq \left \vert \int \norm{f}_\infty g \right \vert \\
%			& = \norm{f}_\infty \left \vert \int g \right \vert  \\
%			& \leq \norm{f}_\infty \int \vert g \vert \\
%			& = \norm{f}_\infty \norm{g}_1
			\left \vert \int fg \right \vert & \leq  \int  \vert fg \vert \text{\ \ (triangle inequality)}\\
			& = \int \vert f \vert \vert g \vert \\
			& \leq \int \norm{f}_\infty \vert g \vert \text{\ \ (monotonicity)}\\
			& = \norm{f}_\infty \norm{g}_1
		\end{align*}
		Thus our functional is bounded by $\norm{g}_1$.

\problem{Ex 22.2 (BBT, ex 13:6.2).} Show that there is a nonzero bounded linear functional on $L^\infty[0,1]$ that vanishes on the (closed) subspace of continuous functions. \bigbreak

	\begin{proof}
		Consider the step fuction $g = \chi_{\RR^+} \in L^\infty$. For any continuous function $f \in L^\infty$ it's easily seen that $\norm{f - g}_\infty \geq \tfrac{1}{2}$. So if $Y$ is the closed subspace of continuous functions then $dist(g, Y) = \tfrac{1}{2} > 0$, and by Theorem 12.38 (Bruckner) we are given that there exists a functional $x^* \in (L^\infty)^*$ such that $\norm{x^*} = 1$, $x^*(g) = \tfrac{1}{2}$, and $x^*(g)=0$ for any continuous function $g$. Thus functional is bounded, nonzero (since it maps our step function elsewhere), and it vanishes on the subspace of continuous functions.
	\end{proof}

%	\begin{proof}
%		The functional on $L^\infty [0, 1]$ will be the distance of the step discontinuity at the point $\tfrac{1}{2}$ from left to right. \\
%		Formally we will define the functional $\phi: L^\infty [0, 1] \to \RR$ by
%		$$
%		\phi(f) = \inf_{\delta > 0} \Big \{ \sup_{x \in (.5, .5 + \delta)} \{ f(\tfrac{1}{2}) - f(x) \} \Big \}
%		$$
%		For continuous functions (in particular they are continuous at $\tfrac{1}{2}$) this value is zero, by definition. Since $f$ is bounded, the largest that $\phi$ could scale it, is to double it (if the function jumped up from the negative bound to the positive bound at $\tfrac{1}{2}$). Clearly $\phi(cf) = c\phi(f)$. \\
%		$\phi(f + g) = \phi(f) + \phi(g)$ is harder to justify formaly, but is true. \\
%		Lastly note that $\phi(\chi_{(.5,1)}) = 1$ so $\phi$ is non-zero.
%	\end{proof}

\problem{Ex 22.3 (BBT, ex 13:6.3)} Show that there is a bounded linear functional on $L^\infty[0,1]$ that is not of the form $f\mapsto\int fg$ for any $g\in L^1[0,1]$. \bigbreak

	\begin{proof}
		Let $\phi$ be a nonzero boudned linear functional on $L^\infty[0,1]$ that vanishes on the (closed) subspace of continuous functions. Such a functional was shown to exist in the previous problem. \bigbreak
		
		Suppose there existed $g \in L^1[0,1]$ such that $\phi(f) = \int fg$. Since the continuous functions are dense in $L^1[0,1]$ we can approximate $g$ with continous funtions. Let $f_n$ be a sequence of continuous functions in $L^1[0,1]$ such that $f_n \to g$ (both in the norm, and pointwise). Then 
		$$
		0 = \lim 0 = \lim \int f_n g = \int g^2
		$$
		Since $0 \leq g^2$ we can say that $g^2 = 0$ almost everywhere, and hence $g = 0$ almost everywhere. But then $\phi$ would be the zero functional and we have a contradiction. \bigbreak
		
		Thus $\phi$ is such a bounded linear functional not of the form $f \mapsto \int fg$.
	\end{proof}
