\problem{Ex 19.1.} Show that $\norm{T}$ is equal to $\sup\{\norm{Tx}:\norm{x}\leq1\}$. \bigbreak

	\begin{proof}
		Let $S = \sup\{\norm{Tx}:\norm{x}\leq1\}$. Then notice that
		\begin{align*}
			\sup\{\norm{Tx}:\norm{x}\leq1\} & \leq \sup\{\norm{T}\norm{x}:\norm{x}\leq1\} \\
			& \leq \sup\{\norm{T}:\norm{x}\leq1\} \\
			= \norm{T}
		\end{align*}
		Thus $S \leq \norm{T}$. \bigbreak
		Let $x \in X$ (assume $x \neq 0$). Then $\norm{\tfrac{1}{\norm{x}}x} = 1$. So by definition 
		\begin{align*}
			\norm{T\tfrac{1}{\norm{x}}x} & \leq S \\
			\tfrac{1}{\norm{x}} \norm{Tx} & \leq S \\
			\norm{Tx} & \leq S \norm{x} \\
		\end{align*}
		Thus $S$ is a bound of $T$ and by definition $\norm{T} \leq S$. \bigbreak
		
		Thus $\norm{T} = \sup\{\norm{Tx}:\norm{x}\leq1\}$.		
	\end{proof}

\problem{Ex 19.3 (BBT, ex 17:7.5).} If $X,Y$ are Banach spaces and $T\in B(X,Y)$, show that $(T^*\phi)(x)=\phi(Tx)$ defines an element of $B(Y^*,X^*)$ such that $\norm{T^*}=\norm{T}$. \bigbreak

	\begin{proof}
		First let $\phi \in Y^*$. Then for any $x \in X$, $Tx \in Y$ and is thus in the domain of $\phi$. So $T^*: Y^* \to X^*$. \bigbreak
		
		Let $\phi, \gamma \in Y^*$. Then 
		\begin{align*}
			\big(T^*(\phi + \gamma) \big)(x) & = (\phi + \gamma)(Tx) \\
			& = \phi(Tx) + \gamma(Tx) \\
			& = (T^*\phi)(x) + (T^*\gamma)(x) \\
			& = \big[(T^*\phi)+ (T^*\gamma)\big](x)
		\end{align*}
		Let $c$ be a scalar. Then
		\begin{align*}
			\big( T^*(c\phi) \big)(x) &= (c\phi)(Tx) \\
			& = c (\phi(Tx)) \\
			& = c(T^* \phi)(x)
		\end{align*}
		We have shown that $T*$ is a linear operator. \bigbreak
		
		Let $\phi \in Y^*$ such that $\norm{\phi} \leq 1$. Let $x \in X$. Then $\norm{Tx} \leq \norm{T}$ and
		\begin{align*}
			\norm{T^* \phi} & = \norm{\phi(Tx)} \\
			& \leq \norm{\phi} \norm{Tx} \\
			& \leq \norm{\phi}\norm{T}
		\end{align*}
		Thus $\norm{T^*} \leq \norm{T}$ by definition.
		
	\end{proof}

\problem{Ex 19.5.} Complete the proof of Corollary 19.4(b) of the notes: If $Y$ is closed in $X$ and $z\notin Y$, then there exists $\phi\in X^*$ such that $\phi(Y)=0$, $\phi(z)\neq0$, and $\norm{\phi}=1$. \bigbreak

	\begin{proof}
		Define $\phi_0$ as in Corollary 18.4b. Let $M = \norm{\phi_0}$. Define $\phi_1 = \tfrac{1}{M}\phi$. Clearly $\phi_1(Y)=0$ still, and $\phi_1(z)\neq 0$.

\problem{Ex 20.1.} Give an example of a function from $\RR$ to $\RR$ which has a closed graph but is not continuous. Give an example of function from $\RR$ to $\RR$ which is continuous and surjective but not open. Is it possible to give a bijective example? \bigbreak

	The function 
	$$
	f(x) = \begin{cases}
		1/x \text{\ \ \ if $x \neq 0$} \\
		0 \text{\ \ \ if $x = 0$}
	\end{cases}
	$$
	Has a closed graph but is not continuous. \bigbreak
	
	The function $f: \RR \to \RR$ given by $f(x) = x^2(x-1)$ is continuous and surjective, however $f\big( (0,1) \big) = [-\tfrac{4}{27},0)$ and thus $f$ is not open. \bigbreak
	
	It is not possible to give a bijective example. It is a theorem from Analysis/Topology that continuous bijections from $\RR$ to $\RR$ have continuous inverses. Since the inverse would be continuous, the function must be open.

\problem{Ex 20.2 (BBT, ex 12:13.2).} Equip the space $C[0,1]$ with both the $L^1$ norm and the supremum norm. Show that the $L^1$ norm is bounded by a constant times the supremum norm. Show that the reverse is not true. Explain why the two results do not contradict the corollary to the open mapping theorem. \bigbreak

	\begin{proof}
		For any function $f \in C[0,1]$, define the constant function $g = \sup\limits_{x \in [0,1]}\{\vert f \vert \}$. Then $\norm{f}_\infty = \norm{g}_\infty$, but since $\vert f \vert  \leq g$, by monotonicity we have that $\norm{f}_1 \leq \norm{g}_1$. Thus $\norm{\cdot}_1$ is bounded by $1\norm{\cdot}_\infty$. \bigbreak
		
		Suppose that there were a constant $M$ such that $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$ is bounded by $M\norm{\cdot}_1$. Then consider the function $f(x) = x^{M} \in C[0,1]$. Then $\norm{f}_\infty = 1$, but $\norm{f}_1 = \tfrac{1}{1+M}$ so $M \norm{f}_1 = \tfrac{1}{1+M} < 1 = \norm{f}_\infty$.
	\end{proof}
	
	This does not violate the corollary to the Open Mapping Theorem because $C[0,1]$ under the $L^1$ norm is not a Banach Space. Consider the sequence of functions $f_n(x) = x^n$. This sequence converges pointwise to 
	$$
	f(x) =
	\begin{cases}
		0 \text{\ \ if $x<1$}\\
		1 \text{\ \ if $x=1$}
	\end{cases}
	$$
	Further, this sequence is Cauchy. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Pick $N$ to be an integer greater than $1/\epsilon$. Then for any $n,m>N$
	\begin{align*}
		\norm{x^n - x^m}_1 & = \int_0^1\vert x^n - x^m \vert dx \\
		& = \int_0^1 x^n - x^m dx \text{\ \ \ (WLOG $m>n$)}\\
		& = \tfrac{1}{n+1} - \tfrac{1}{m+1} \\
		& < \tfrac{1}{n+1} < \tfrac{1}{N} < \epsilon
	\end{align*}
	Since this sequence is Cauchy, but the pointwise limit is not in $C[0,1]$ this is not a Banach Space and the Open Mapping Theorm is not contradicted.
