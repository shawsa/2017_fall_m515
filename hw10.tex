\problem{Ex 19.1.} Show that $|T|$ is equal to $\sup\{|Tx|:|x|\leq1\}$.


\bigbreak
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\problem{Ex 19.3 (BBT, ex 17:7.5).} If $X,Y$ are Banach spaces and $T\in B(X,Y)$, show that $(T^*\phi)(x)=\phi(Tx)$ defines an element of $B(Y^*,X^*)$ such that $|T^*|=|T|$.

\bigbreak
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\problem{Ex 19.5.} Complete the proof of Corollary 19.4(b) of the notes: If $Y$ is closed in $X$ and $z\notin Y$, then there exists $\phi\in X^*$ such that $\phi(Y)=0$, $\phi(z)\neq0$, and $|\phi|=1$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\problem{Ex 20.1.} Give an example of a function from $\RR$ to $\RR$ which has a closed graph but is not continuous. Give an example of function from $\RR$ to $\RR$ which is continuous and surjective but not open. Is it possible to give a bijective example?
Ex 20.2 (BBT, ex 12:13.2). Equip the space $C[0,1]$ with both the $L^1$ norm and the supremum norm. Show that the $L^1$ norm is bounded by a constant times the supremum norm. Show that the reverse is not true. Explain why the two results do not contradict the corollary to the open mapping theorem.
